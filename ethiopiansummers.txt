Pretty cool!] </p>\n<p>The morning started off with a planning meeting for the Multilingual Education Network meeting that is scheduled for Thursday. I have been asked to give a presentation on the topic of MTB-MLE networks around the world. The presentation was presented twice before, so I have only had to make minor changes to the formatting and content of the deck. </p>\n<p>Around 12pm, I left the office with one of the literacy consultants who invited me to go book shopping with her. She was very kind and basically allowed me to tag along as she made her way through the city to a bookstore that sold supplementary reading materials in 4 local languages. We got <em>shiro wat</em> at the Goethe Institute near <em>Sidist Kilo </em>for lunch. After lunch we ordered macchiatos and sipped them slowly as we waited for the rain to pass. Apparently, I&#8217;ve come to Addis in the worst season of the year - the rainy season! It is cold, rainy, and cloudy nearly every day. </p>\n<p>From the Goethe Institute we took a mini taxi down the street one stop or so to the bookstore. The actual store was closed but we were able to find the office and looked through the materials they were selling. We ran into two of my colleague&#8217;s friends at the bookstore who had come to see the same materials that we were interested in. </p>\n<p>After the bookstore, we went to the market called <em>Shiro Merra (meadow of shiro </em>haha). My colleague has lived in Ethiopia for 20 years and is a perfect Amharic speaker. I was very grateful to learn about how to travel through the city from her. </p>\n<p>Two funny things happened today:</p>\n<p>First, as we were walking through the market, a young Ethiopian boy spotted us and started shouting &#8220;China China!&#8221; He called for his friends to do the same and they were excited to have spotted Ferenjes (whom they believed to be Chinese). This was the first time I&#8217;ve been mistaken for Chinese! </p>\n<p>Second, as I crossed the road in <em>Mexico</em> (one of the circles near <em>Arat Kilo </em>and <em>Sar-beyt</em>) I saw two Asian men in hard hats crossing in the opposite direction. One of the two guys stared me down nearly the whole way, so I just stared back. I have previously had mixed feelings about how the Chinese are building roads all over Ethiopia and as I tried to win the stare-down I felt like saying &#8220;<em>What is your sneaky country doing here?!&#8221; </em>Then I realized, looks who&#8217;s talking! The American white-girl who&#8217;s come to Africa for the first time. :) </p>\n<p>*My apologies for saying that China is sneaky. I love China. I really do. </p>"}
