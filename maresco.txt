It hasn&#8217;t fully sunk in that I am actually going back in just a few weeks.<span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Sometimes you can&#8217;t really explain what it is about a place that draws you in. </span><span>I figured the best way to try would be to dig up some of my old memories from my various trips to Ethiopia and post them here for old times&#8217; sake. </span><span>Some of the photos are courtesy of various friends with whom I travelled. Hopefully they will forgive me for poaching them off of various Facebook albums and blogs.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/d239f5d470e987b94be1594386dd6325/tumblr_inline_mo664lVQv21qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><span>My first exposure to Ethiopia was when I met these two guys. Mo and Wondy lived in the U.S. but really wanted to work in church ministry back in their home country. My dad was a pastor and they asked him to mentor them. So they came to live with us for awhile around 2002. Soon, they both moved back to pursue their dream in Ethiopia, giving up a comfortable life in the states that many other Ethiopians strive for.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/b7851a5d147d5715a7e26dedf764778b/tumblr_inline_mo66fhnPQs1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><span>In May 2003, I traveled with my dad to Addis as he continued to mentor these guys as well as other leaders in their church. It was my first transatlantic trip and my first encounter with real poverty. While I was mostly a spectator and tourist during this trip, I left without feeling overwhelmed by the cultural differences but rather a real comfort with these </span><span>people.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/48a624de2ce57aef40bf6de44d0779a7/tumblr_inline_mo66j97RfL1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Nearly five years later, I got a job working on a film crew to film a documentary that would be shot in Germany and Ethiopia. I was thrilled to get to go back, and to even get paid to do so. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/79ed9f9b0749409dad297c5c2137a2dd/tumblr_inline_mo66rh5QtM1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><span>I was a year and a half into my engineering studies at the University of Maryland and had been planning on getting involved with Engineers Without Borders as soon as possible. </span><span>Before leaving for Ethiopia, I had gotten a lead on a potential opportunity for EWB to work in the town of Addis Alem. The lead hadn&#8217;t been fully vetted yet, so I took the opportunity to arrange a meeting with the contact and spent a half day visiting the town, meeting with the mayor and looking at possible project sites. I wrote up my initial assessment, submitted it to the EWB board, and soon there was a new project underway. The Ethiopia program at UMD continues to this day and will see a third implementation take place this summer.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/f43b34c27b6aac9020e03ea06f81a981/tumblr_inline_mo66wyXY281qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The next January (2009), my project co-lead Dylan and I set out with our professor David Lovell and a professional engineer to further explore the project opportunities I had learned about as well as other potential options that were sure to surface. We spent 8 days building relationships with the local community and trying to navigate the political and technical concerns inherent in bringing a bunch of college students to do engineering work in a developing country. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/cd6727695cd94b566c240d55614d8775/tumblr_inline_mo672gcXDC1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>We did some ridiculous things like jump off of rocks into contaminated lakes.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/449587cf79132ca30b981aca738d0aee/tumblr_inline_mo67vgRPAi1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><span>During this trip, we also got to experience Timkat, the Ethiopian Coptic Orthodox version of Epiphany. Overwhelming numbers of people swarmed the streets to take part in beautiful processionals carrying replicas of the ark of the covenant down the street (the real ark is believed to be tucked away in a chapel in Axum, Ethiopia). The picture above is in Addis Alem, but we also visited an open field in Addis that had to have held hundreds of thousands of people all forming circles and dancing, drumming, and chanting the day away. Such a spectacular experience.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/9f6edf03852aae8f07d01e3322f64787/tumblr_inline_mo675bSDTX1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>In May, we came back after having settled on the idea of building a youth community center, which would be part of a compound that aimed to keep youth from idling on the streets and otherwise getting into trouble. I also spent time researching the possibility of providing microfinance for a youth-run concrete block production enterprise, and got to meet with USAID representatives and various local business development agencies. On this trip, we brought along our buddy Ed Elder, a grad student studying structural engineering who proved invaluable to the design effort. This trip was also about a week and a half in duration, during which we worked with the community to lay the foundation for the building which we would construct when we returned with the full team that summer. While I had taken a building materials course at UMD, it was a whole different experience getting to do it hands-on (I mean really hands-on&#8230;we were lucky to have a small hand-cranked mixer). And even though I had studied the science of concrete mixing in school, many of these guys knew 10 times more than I did about how the stuff actually worked.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/25afdca8560806f4a4e44a5bd1e86ba3/tumblr_inline_mo68pyvmSE1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n\n<p>In January &#8216;10, we headed back with a team of 13. We had shipments of concrete block come in. We purchased eucalyptus timbers from the local supply and built trusses using a design our team had come up with during the intervening months. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/105e720e89b292101e417ebcd59a3c55/tumblr_inline_mo67bk3BmQ1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>We had a ton of help from the local community, most of whom had more building experience than we did. It&#8217;s natural to finish a project like this and ask what we really brought to the community, and while I&#8217;d like to say it was cutting edge engineering principles, the answer may be that we brought primarily time, money, and a friendly smile. One could argue that we as students learned much more from them than they did from us. However, one of the things I respect about EWB is that they discourage hit-and-run projects and are sensitive to community dynamics. They encourage schools to make a 5-year commitment to a community when beginning a new program. UMD has been involved in Addis Alem for almost 4 years now and has definitely made some significant contributions to the community.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/f2699e0db68e5bfed6f9e8f0e542ac92/tumblr_inline_mo67j3UgC41qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><span>This is the January 2010 team. We worked hard but also had a ton of fun together. </span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/2a295b82d6239bf3e307cde7499f9341/tumblr_inline_mo67k7cxTJ1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>One of my highlights of the trip was hiking and horseback riding around Lake Wenchee, several hours west of Addis.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/854add3059073cfb87aaeb8599d00702/tumblr_inline_mo67m6r4ie1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The coffee in Ethiopia is to die for. The &#8220;bunna&#8221; comes in many varieties. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/8cda4d2d828d541130c8ef2d8daf2210/tumblr_inline_mo67nzSfmP1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><span>Ethiopian food is also world-renowned. For good reason. This is a veggie dish that they serve on certain days of the week and on various religious holidays when some people don&#8217;t eat meat. But it was one of my favorite dishes and I&#8217;d often ask for it even when meat was available.</span></p>\n<p><span><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/12d158218bf0a20ab9dc3457c2e4fa75/tumblr_inline_mo68g8b06R1qz4rgp.jpg\"/></span></p>\n<p><span>The experience of working in Ethiopia has shaped me more than most anything else I&#8217;ve done, and probably more than I even realize. I can&#8217;t wait to get back and will definitely be visiting my friends when I do. </span></p>"}
